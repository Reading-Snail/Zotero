Sit-to-Stand (StS) is a fundamental daily activity that can be challenging for stroke survivors due to strength, motor control, and proprioception deficits in their lower limbs. Existing therapies involve repetitive StS exercises, but these can be physically demanding for therapists while assistive devices may limit patient participation and hinder motor learning. To address these challenges, this work proposes the use of two lower-limb exoskeletons to mediate physical interaction between therapists and patients during a StS rehabilitative task. This approach offers several advantages, including improved therapist-patient interaction, safety enforcement, and performance quantification. The whole body control of the two exoskeletons transmits online feedback between the two users, but at the same time assists in movement and ensures balance, and thus helping subjects with greater difficulty. In this study we present the architecture of the framework, presenting and discussing some technical choices made in the design.
